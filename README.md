## How it works

The "youtube-to-netdisk" provides a web interface via which you can trigger a task that starts a process downloading as well as uploading the video to Baidu net disk.

## How to use

Before you start working with this program, read the following introduction carefully.

### Python Script

The two python scripts are the core of the program. You can manually run them.

For instance,

```
python3 download.py https://youtu.be/yourlinkhere
```

This will download the video to current directory.

```
python3 syncBaidu.py filenamedownloadedjustnow.mp4 examplefolder
```

This will upload the video to the folder 我的应用数据/bypy/examplefolder in your Baidu net disk.

### Baidu Net Disk

If it is the first time you use bypy, you should manually run bypy or the script `syncBaidu.py`(check above for usage).
Bypy will ask you for authorization, afterwards it will be able to access your net disk (with saved credential).

### Server

Some explanation of configs.

+ **python_cmd** The python command. Usually it is `python3`, for some OS, like ArchLinux, it is `python`.
+ **temp_path** The path where temp file for logs are stored.
+ **netdisk_folder** To which videos are uploaded.
+ **netdisk_sharelink** && **netdisk_sharepass** You can create a share link of the folder (parent of the video), after that the program can generate a share link for each video uploaded, e.g. https://pan.baidu.com/s/xxxxxx?fid=1111111

The web interface will be listening at **port**.

Videos will be stored at folder `static` (Perhaps should be created manually?)

### Build Front-End

Build Front-end so that you can see tasks and running processes from the website.

cd to app/, and then run

```
yarn install
yarn build
```

### IFTTT

Now that we can trigger one task to download and upload video for us through the web interface (refer to API doc above).

With [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com)'s awesome service we can watch a subscribed channel and trigger tasks automatically (use the Youtube and WebHook service) when a new video is published.

However in my scenario I do not always need the videos, so here the "keywords" are. Only videos with keywords in the title will be carried.
For instance, according to my case, the keywords are "ラブライブ" and "虹ヶ咲", and one of my subscribed channels is "電撃オンライン", which is likely to also publish videos that has nothing to do with the topic I want.

If you don't need this "keyword" feature, emmmm, maybe you can just add a blank keyword?
